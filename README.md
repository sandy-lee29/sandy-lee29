## Hi there I'm Sangmin (or Sandy) 👋 

📚 I love solving business problems with data! With expertise in SQL, Python, R, and machine learning, I leverage advanced analytics to drive data-driven decisions. <br>
🎓 With a background in Data Analytics and Social Science from UC Berkeley, I have experience analyzing large datasets and developing predictive models to generate actionable business insights.  <br>
🔗 Here you can check out my portfolio of data science projects. I also write about the same topic in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir) blog posts.  
📫 I’m always open to discussing projects and opportunities. Feel free to reach out at sandylee@berkeley.edu 

## Data Science Projects 

### 🎵 App Review Analysis System for Music Streaming Apps
Developed an AI-powered App Review Analysis System using prompt engineering to automate sentiment analysis, issue tagging, and topic categorization for 10,000 reviews from the top five music apps. <br>

  👉 [View Streamlit Dashboard](https://music-app-review-dashboard.streamlit.app/) <br>
- Automated sentiment analysis to classify reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative using OpenAI’s GPT model.
- Automatically extracted key user concerns and feature requests through AI-driven issue detection, providing actionable insights for product teams.
- Standardized topics using NLP-based similarity matching, aligning issues into industry-specific categories.
- Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize user feedback trends, enabling data-driven product improvements.

### 🚗 Predicting Coupon Acceptance in Mobility Services <br>
Built a machine learning model to predict coupon acceptance using the [In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/invehicle-coupon-recommendation). <br>

- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and reducing multicollinearity.
- Conducted model comparison and selected CatBoost Classifier for its high Recall (0.836) and ROC AUC (0.834).
- Analyzed feature importance to derive business insights, such as optimizing coupon types, location-based offers, and expiration durations.

### ❤️‍🩹 Predicting Heart Attack Risk <br>
Developed a predictive model for heart attack risk assessment using the [Synthetic Heart Attack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset?resource=download). <br> 
  👉 [View Project](https://github.com/sandy-lee29/heart-attack-prediction) <br>
- Performed data cleaning and feature engineering, including splitting blood pressure into systolic/diastolic values and encoding categorical variables.
- Trained and optimized a Decision Tree Classifier using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Identified key risk factors through feature importance analysis and provided insights into preventive healthcare strategies and model limitations.

### 📱 Analyzing the Impact of Social Media Deplatforming on Misinformation Spread <br>
Replicated and extended the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis from the 2024 study [“Post-January 6th deplatforming reduced the reach of misinformation on Twitter”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07524-8), published in Nature. <br>

  👉 [View Medium Post](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir/evaluating-the-effectiveness-of-twitters-deplatforming-as-a-content-moderation-strategy-1066dea05a46) <br>
-  Used Difference-in-Differences analysis to measure the impact of Twitter’s deplatforming on misinformation spread, analyzing user engagement trends and migration patterns.
-  Evaluated key assumptions behind the study and examined the broader implications of content moderation strategies on online discourse.
