## Hi there I'm Sangmin (or Sandy) ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸ“š I love solving problems with data! With a strong foundation in SQL, Python, R, and machine learning, I leverage advanced analytics to drive data-driven decisions. <br>
ðŸŒ± With a background in Data Analytics and Social Science from UC Berkeley, I have experience analyzing large datasets and developing predictive models to generate actionable business insights.  <br>
ðŸ”— Here you can check out my portfolio of data science projects. I also write about the same topic on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir).  
ðŸ“« Iâ€™m always open to discussing projects and opportunities. Feel free to reach out at sandylee@berkeley.edu
