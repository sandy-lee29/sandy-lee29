## Hi there I'm Sangmin (or Sandy) 👋 

📚 I love solving problems with data! With a strong foundation in SQL, Python, R, and machine learning, I leverage advanced analytics to drive data-driven decisions. <br>
🌱 With a background in Data Analytics and Social Science from UC Berkeley, I have experience analyzing large datasets and developing predictive models to generate actionable business insights.  <br>
🔗 Here you can check out my portfolio of data science projects. I also write about the same topic in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir) blog posts.  
📫 I’m always open to discussing projects and opportunities. Feel free to reach out at sandylee@berkeley.edu 

## Data Science Projects 

### 1. 🚗 Predicting Coupon Acceptance in Mobility Services <br>
Built a machine learning model to predict coupon acceptance using the In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation dataset. <br>

  👉 [View Medium Post](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir/driving-sales-with-machine-learning-predicting-coupon-acceptance-in-the-automotive-industry-2491d04db677) <br>
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and reducing multicollinearity.
- Conducted model comparison and selected CatBoost Classifier for its high Recall (0.836) and ROC AUC (0.834).
- Analyzed feature importance to derive business insights, such as optimizing coupon types, location-based offers, and expiration durations.

### 2. ❤️‍🩹 Predicting Heart Attack Risk <br>
Developed a predictive model for heart attack risk assessment. <br> 
  👉 [View Project](https://github.com/sandy-lee29/heart_attack_prediction) <br>
- Performed data cleaning and feature engineering, including splitting blood pressure into systolic/diastolic values and encoding categorical variables.
- Trained and optimized a Decision Tree Classifier using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Identified key risk factors through feature importance analysis and provided insights into preventive healthcare strategies and model limitations.

### 3. 📱 Analyzing the Impact of Social Media Deplatforming on Misinformation Spread <br>
Replicated and extended the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis from the 2024 study "Post-January 6th deplatforming reduced the reach of misinformation on Twitter". <br>
  👉 [View Project](https://github.com/sandy-lee29/Twitter_DiD_Analysis_Project) <br>
  👉 [View Medium Post](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir/evaluating-the-effectiveness-of-twitters-deplatforming-as-a-content-moderation-strategy-1066dea05a46) <br>
-  Used the original dataset to assess how Twitter’s deplatforming intervention affected misinformation spread.
-  Evaluated key assumptions behind the study and examined the broader implications of content moderation strategies on online discourse.
