## Hi there I'm Sangmin (or Sandy) 👋 

📚 I love solving business problems with data! With expertise in SQL, Python, R, and machine learning, I leverage advanced analytics to drive data-driven decisions. <br>
🎓 With a background in Data Analytics and Social Science from UC Berkeley, I have experience analyzing large datasets and developing predictive models to generate actionable business insights.  <br>
🔗 Here you can check out my portfolio of data science projects. I also write about the same topic in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir) blog posts.  
📫 I’m always open to discussing projects and opportunities. Feel free to reach out at sandylee@berkeley.edu 

## Data Science Projects 

### 🎵 App Review Analysis System
#### 1. Data Pipeline
Developed an end-to-end AI pipeline for extracting actionable insights from app reviews. The system comprises three key components:
- Review Scraper: Automated collection of reviews from Google Play and App Store
- AI Tagging Engine: GPT-powered sentiment analysis, issue detection, and topic categorization
- Hierarchical Analysis: Automated grouping of issues into main categories and sub-issues 

**Key Achievements:**
- Processed 10,000+ reviews with AI-powered classification
- Developed customizable framework applicable to any app category
- Automated data processing pipeline for consistent analysis

#### 2. Intelligence Dashboard
Built a comprehensive Streamlit dashboard that transforms processed reviews into actionable insights: 

**Key Features:**
- Multi-page dashboard with interactive filtering
- AI-powered issue analysis and impact assessment
- Revenue risk scoring and priority ranking
- Automated executive summaries and recommendations
- Exportable reports in PDF and CSV formats

### 🚗 Predicting In-Vehicle Coupon Acceptance <br>
Built a machine learning model to predict in-vehicle coupon acceptance using the [In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/invehicle-coupon-recommendation). <br>

- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and reducing multicollinearity.
- Conducted model comparison and selected CatBoost Classifier for its high Recall (0.836) and ROC AUC (0.834).
- Analyzed feature importance to derive business insights, such as optimizing coupon types, location-based offers, and expiration durations.

### ❤️‍🩹 Predicting Heart Attack Risk <br>
Developed a predictive model for heart attack risk assessment using the [Synthetic Heart Attack Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset?resource=download). <br> 
  👉 [View Project](https://github.com/sandy-lee29/heart-attack-prediction) <br>
- Performed data cleaning and feature engineering, including splitting blood pressure into systolic/diastolic values and encoding categorical variables.
- Trained and optimized a Decision Tree Classifier using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Identified key risk factors through feature importance analysis and provided insights into preventive healthcare strategies and model limitations.

### 📱 Analyzing the Impact of Social Media Deplatforming on Misinformation Spread <br>
Replicated and extended the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis from the 2024 study [“Post-January 6th deplatforming reduced the reach of misinformation on Twitter”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07524-8), published in Nature. <br>

  👉 [View Medium Post](https://medium.com/@sangmin.lee.ir/evaluating-the-effectiveness-of-twitters-deplatforming-as-a-content-moderation-strategy-1066dea05a46) <br>
-  Used Difference-in-Differences analysis to measure the impact of Twitter’s deplatforming on misinformation spread, analyzing user engagement trends and migration patterns.
-  Evaluated key assumptions behind the study and examined the broader implications of content moderation strategies on online discourse.
